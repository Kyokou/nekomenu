Nekomenu is a simple **dynamic, auto-updated** applications menu for openbox desktops.

The default Openbox menu is a static XML file. Every time you install/remove an application from your system, you have to manually update the XML file to add/remove the application entry.

Nekomenu does that automatically. It stores a SHA1 hash generated by reading the contents of the `/usr/share/applications` folder, and every time something changes there, Nekomenu updates itself.

Nekomenu is part of the [Neko](http://github.com/ansdor/neko) project, but it can be used with any openbox-based desktop. You just need to add a single line to the openbox `menu.xml`.

### How to install?

```
wget https://raw.github.com/ansdor/nekomenu/master/nekomenu.py
chmod +x nekomenu.py
sudo mv nekomenu.py /usr/bin/nekomenu
```

Then add a line to your `~/.config/openbox/menu.xml` containing `<menu execute="nekomenu" id="NekoMenu" label="Neko Menu"/>`
